# CPP Labs

All C & C++ course practice classwork tasks & homeworks

Target C standard: ``C99``
Target C++ standard: ``unspecified`` (for build i use C++20 but mostly use C++17 features and below)

Problem statements can be found [here](https://github.com/mecchmatProjects/CppCourse/tree/master)

## Repo structure

For each lab - separate folder ``labs/lab[i]`` & branch ``lab[i]``

Completed labs then merged into master through a pull request and teacher review.

## Status

Most labs are fully complete (at least classwork)
But some class tasks stay incompleted (partially completed can be found by searching for "TODO" in comments)
Also completed only one (my personal) variant of homework.
