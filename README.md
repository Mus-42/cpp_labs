# CPP Labs

All C & C++ course practice classwork tasks & homeworks

Target C standard: ``C99``
Target C++ standard: ``unspecified`` (something around C++11/C++14?)

## Repo structure

For each lab - separate folder ``labs/lab[i]`` & branch ``lab[i]``

Completed labs then merged into master through a pull request and teacher review.
